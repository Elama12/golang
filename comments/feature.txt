Features of Go:
1. Support for environment adopting patterns similar to dynamic languages. For example, type inference (x := 0 is valid declaration of a variable x of type int)
2. Compilation time is fast.
3. Inbuilt concurrency support: lightweight processes (via go routines), channels, select statement.
4. Go programs are simple, concise, and safe.
5. Support for Interfaces and Type embedding.
6. Production of statically linked native binaries without external dependencies.

Excluded features:
1. Support for type inheritance
2. Support for method or operator overloading
3. Support for circular dependencies among packages
4. Support for pointer arithmetic
5. Support for assertions
6. Support for generic programming
